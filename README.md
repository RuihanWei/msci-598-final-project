# Utils, Preprocessing and Feature Extraction Credits
##### In the following sections of code, some preprocessing and util code were adapted from fnc-1-baseline (https://github.com/FakeNewsChallenge/fnc-1-baseline) and UCL Machine Reading - FNC-1 Submission (https://github.com/uclnlp/fakenewschallenge). Specifically, funcitons to generate the features word overlap, refuting, polarity, and co-occurrences were adopted from the baseline code. Functions and classes to preprocess and generate TF vectors and cos similiarity are adopted from UCL Machine Reading - FNC-1 Submission. However, both are modifed to serve our design.

# Model Design and Implmentation Credits

#### The CNN architecture design and the development of the code is inspired by MSCI 598 Week 9 Tutorial (https://github.com/kiasar/NLP-tutorials-waterloo-MSCI-598---Winter-2022/blob/main/Week%209/Keras_CNN_text_relatedness.ipynb) and the paper: https://aclanthology.org/2020.aacl-srw.4.pdf. The MLP portion of the code was inspired by UCL Machine Reading - FNC-1 Submission (https://github.com/uclnlp/fakenewschallenge).
